      While John Wick shepherds Chad Stahelski (director/producer) and Keanu
      Reeves (star/producer) have said they always like to take their time
      between installments — not to mention that John Wick: Chapter 4 ended
      (spoiler alert) in seemingly final fashion, Lionsgate is looking to the
      future. Lionsgate chairman Joe Drake assured investors in a recent
      financial call that the company was all-in on more Wick. "We're now moving
      across that franchise, not just in the AAA video game space, but looking
      at what the regular cadence of spin-offs, television really growing that
      universe so that there is a steady cadence of a franchise that there's
      clear appetite by the audience," Drake said. "What is official is that, as
      you know, Ballerina [starring Ana de Armas] is the first spinoff that
      comes out next year. We're in development on three others, including John
      Wick 5 and including television series, The Continental, will be airing
      soon. And so, we're building out the world and when that five movie comes,
      will be organic – will be organically grown out of how we're starting to
      tell those stories. But you can rely on a regular cadence of John Wick."
      Tick tock, Mr. Wick… We'll see if Reeves and Stahelski really do return
      for more, but you know a studio isn't going to let go of a successful
      franchise.
