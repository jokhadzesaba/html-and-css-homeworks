      Planetary scientists now know how thick the Martian crust is, thanks to
      the strongest Marsquake ever observed. On average, the crust is between 42
      and 56 kilometers thick, researchers report in a paper to appear in
      Geophysical Research Letters. That’s roughly 70 percent thicker than the
      average continental crust on Earth. The measurement was based on data from
      NASA’s InSight lander, a stationary seismometer that recorded waves
      rippling through Mars’ interior for four Earth years. Last May, the entire
      planet shook with a magnitude 4.7 quake that lasted more than six hours
      (SN: 5/13/22). “We were really fortunate that we got this quake,” says
      seismologist Doyeon Kim of ETH Zurich.

      InSight recorded seismic waves from the quake that circled Mars up to
      three times. That let Kim and colleagues infer the crust thickness over
      the whole planet. Not only is the crust thicker than that of the Earth and
      the moon, but it’s also inconsistent across the Red Planet, the team
      found. And that might explain a known north-south elevation difference on
      Mars. Topological and gravity data from Mars orbiters have shown that the
      planet’s northern hemisphere is substantially lower than the southern one.
      Researchers had suspected that density might play a part: Perhaps the
      rocks that make up northern Mars have a different density than those of
      southern Mars. But the crust is thinner in the northern hemisphere, Kim
      and colleagues found, so the rocks in both hemispheres probably have the
      same average densities. That finding helps scientists narrow down the
      explanations for why the difference exists in the first place. Knowing the
      crust’s depth, the team also calculated that much of Mars’ internal heat
      probably originates in the crust. Most of this heat comes from radioactive
      elements such as potassium, uranium and thorium. An estimated 50 to 70
      percent of those elements are probably in the crust rather than the
      underlying mantle, computer simulations suggest. That supports the idea
      that parts of Mars still have volcanic activity, contrary to a long-held
      belief that the Red Planet is dead
