      GM Magnus Carlsen and GM Jan-Krzysztof Duda fought a memorable and
      thrilling final round of the Superbet Poland Rapid & Blitz 2023, where the
      former held his nerve to hold a draw and win the event with a score of 24
      points and pocket the top prize of $40,000 and 13 Grand Chess Tour points.
      Duda finished second with 23 points for $30,000 and 10 GCT points, while
      GM Wesley So and GM Maxime Vachier-Lagrave tied for third and fourth
      places with 21.5 points to pocket $22,500 and 7.5 GCT each. Carlsen began
      the fifth and final day where he left off from the previous day, extending
      his winning streak to 7/7. At one point, he even scored a blistering 10.5
      points from 11 games between the 14th to 24th rounds. He overtook the
      overnight leader Duda by the 20th round and extended his lead to two
      points by the 23rd round. However, Duda caught up to just a point below
      him at the end of the penultimate round, and Carlsen fended off a spirited
      challenge from Duda in the final round to draw the game and finish a point
      ahead of the rest of the field.Carlsen's play on the final day was a case
      of continuing to employ off-beat openings with the black pieces,
      effortlessly converting advantageous positions, outplaying his opponents
      with trademark technique from equal endgames, and keeping his nerve and
      playing steadily under pressureâ€”be it in difficult positions or under the
      pressure of the clock.With a 1.5 points lead over Duda, Carlsen faced his
      stiffest challenge of the entire day from GM Levon Aronian in the
      penultimate round, who seemed to have a huge advantage at one point. This
      game was one of the highlights of the day.This draw allowed Duda to come
      within a point difference in the standings with just the final round left
      when they faced each other. It proved to be a fascinating clash between
      these two players, who delighted chess lovers with their play throughout
      the event. It was a highly tense affair with so much drama, producing our
