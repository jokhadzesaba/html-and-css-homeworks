      Alonso switched from his hard tyres to mediums as the first signs of a
      shower hit some areas of the track. After the rain intensified and spread
      over the whole circuit, he quickly came in again for intermediates. Alonso
      held onto his second place, but Krack insists that had the Spaniard made a
      single stop instead of two he still wouldn’t have beaten race winner Max
      Verstappen.He stressed that the Silverstone outfit made the right call
      with the available information at the time. "We need to look at the whole
      thing, how it went,” said Krack. “Obviously, you try to stay out as long
      as you can in such conditions when you do not really know what's going to
      happen. “We did not anticipate so much rain, to be honest. So we thought
      that it would just be a short shower, and drying quickly because the track
      was very hot. Then normally, you would say, okay, we stay out one more,
      two or three more laps, but the tyres were worn already quite a lot. “And
      we saw the temperatures going down. So that was a bit of a risk. When the
      car came in then with this information, we said, okay, let's fit the
      mediums. But then when the car left, shortly after we saw that it was
      really a lot of rain. And we had to come back.” Krack admitted that the
      team hadn’t expected the rain to intensify in the manner that it did, and
      didn't think it was wet enough for the inters to last. “Honestly, we
      thought we could go to the end with the mediums because it will dry
      quickly,” he said. “But then we misjudged a bit that it was raining
      because in this part of the track [the pitlane] it took very long before
      it started to rain. “And also this area, it rained the least. So probably
      that was a bit a misjudgement, because we thought also that the inters
      would wear down massively in this part of the track. “At the end of the
      day, it was a conscious decision to go on the mediums. And we saw then a
      lap later that it was not going to work. And we decided to call him back.”
      Krack said Alonso didn’t lose victory with the call: "No, I don't think it
      was lost. Because if we had fitted intermediates Max would have fitted
      intermediates as well. And also he had the gap. So I don't think it would
      have changed much. “I think overall we must not be too greedy, we should
      look back and see what were our objectives. We came here to do better than
      what we have done so far. I think this we managed. And I think the Red
      Bulls were a little bit too fast for us.“
