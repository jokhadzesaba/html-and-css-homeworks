      China sent its first civilian astronaut into orbit on Tuesday, as it
      launched the Shenzhou-16 mission to its space station for its second
      in-orbit crew rotation, marking another step forward for the country’s
      ambitious space program. The three Shenzhou-16 astronauts blasted off from
      the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the desert of China’s Gansu
      province at 9:31 a.m. on Tuesday morning, headed for the Tiangong space
      station orbiting earth. The crew – Jing Haipeng, Zhu Yangzhu, and Gui
      Haichao – will take over from the Shenzhou-15 astronauts, who have been
      abroad China’s newly completed Tiangong space station since November, to
      start their own five-month stint aboard the station. It is China’s fifth
      manned mission to the space station since 2021. The Shenzhou-15 crew
      aboard the station were pictured watching the launch of their replacement
      crew via live stream. The two crews were expected to meet on the station
      around 6.5 hours time after the launch, state media said. Among the
      Shenzhou-16 crew, Gui, a professor at China’s prestigious aeronautics
      institution Beihang University who pursued his postdoctoral studies in
      Canada, is the first Chinese civilian to be on a spaceflight. All other
      astronauts have been members of China’s People’s Liberation Army. Gui will
      operate payloads for space experiments, while Jing and Zhu will operate
      and manage the spacecraft, in addition to carrying out technical tests,
      the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said in a press conference on Monday
      introducing the crew.

      Jing, the mission commander, is a space veteran who was among China’s
      first team of astronauts in 1998 and has already completed three manned
      flight missions. The mission marks the first space flights for Zhu and
      Gui, both born in 1986. Gui’s selection for the crew generated keen
      interest in Chinese online media, not only for his position as the first
      civilian astronaut, but because an accessory he was wearing in official
      photos that’s not typically seen on those headed to space – eyeglasses.
      Several media outlets on Monday responded to the online discussion over
      how a person without perfect vision could be physically cleared for a
      space mission. State-run China Daily cited former astronaut Yang Liwei,
      now a top official in China’s manned space program, explaining that as
      division of labor on missions became more specialized, there were
      different criteria for different crew members.
