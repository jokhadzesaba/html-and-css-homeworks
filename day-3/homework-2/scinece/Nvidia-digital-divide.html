      The world is at a ‘tipping point of a new computing era’, Nvidia Group has
      noted at a recent conference at the Computex Forum in Taipei. The company
      CEO Jensen Huang has claimed ‘We have closed the digital divide. Everyone
      is a programmer now – you just have to say something to the computer’. As
      one of the leading providers of chips and computing systems for artificial
      intelligence (AI), Nvidia anticipates that the widespread adoption of AI
      will revolutionise every industry, propelled by its user-friendly nature.
      To meet the surging demand for AI applications, Nvidia is building a
      supercomputer called ‘Israel-1’. Nvidia works with 800 startups in Israel
      and tens of thousands of software engineers. The system is expected to
      become the fastest AI computer with a delivery performance of up to eight
      exaflops. One exaflop can perform 1 quintillion – or
      1,000,000,000,000,000,000 – calculations per second. Earlier this year,
      Nvidia announced its cooperation with the University of Bristol (UK) to
      build a new supercomputer using a new Nvidia chip that would compete with
      Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. ChatGPT by OpenAI is among the AI
      systems, built with thousands of Nvidia GPUs.
