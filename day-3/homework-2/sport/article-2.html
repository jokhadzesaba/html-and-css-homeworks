      News revealed earlier this month that Messi is set to leave current club
      Paris Saint-Germain at the end of his contract, with Barcelona president
      Joan Laporta admitting that the club are looking into bringing the him
      back.Messi, who scored 672 goals in 778 appearances for Barca between 2003
      and 2021, has spent the last two seasons at PSG after Barcelona let him
      move for a free due to being unable to renew his contract.Asked about the
      impact Messi would have on this Barcelona team, who won the LaLiga title
      this season, Xavi told Barcelona-based newspaper SPORT: "I'm in no doubt
      that if Messi were to return, he would help us in what we are wanting to
      achieve with our football. "I am in no doubt and I've told this to the
      president. He continues to be a determined footballer, he has the hunger
      still."I am in no doubt and I've told this to the president. He continues
      to be a determined footballer, he has the hunger still."He's still a
      winner, he's a leader and he's different. At Barcelona, we've not have the
      same level since what we reached as a pinnacle in 2010. Messi's
      representatives were in talks about a contract renewal with PSG and
      everything was looking positive during the World Cup in Qatar but the
      dynamic changed and his departure from Paris suits all parties. PSG
      consider the move to sign Messi as a free agent in the summer of 2021 to
      have been a success on and off the pitch, but sections of the club's fans
      have turned on the player since they were knocked out of the Champions
      League by Bayern Munich last month.Messi still believes that he can play
      at the highest level in Europe and Barcelona have made no secret of their
      desire to re-sign him this summer. It remains to be seen whether they can
      afford to offer him a new contract but he is much more likely to stay in
      Europe than move to Inter Miami - or any other MLS club - or Saudi Arabia
      at this stage of his career.
