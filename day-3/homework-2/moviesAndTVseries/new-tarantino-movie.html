      Planning to kick off pre-pre-production and the casting process for his
      next — and still, according to him, final — film, Quentin Tarantino has
      revealed more about what it'll be. According to the writer/director, The
      Movie Critic will be based on a real person, but not as has been
      speculated, Pauline Kael. Instead, it'll be someone far less well known.
      Tarantino, speaking to Deadline's Baz Bamigboye at Cannes (where the
      director is presenting a screening of John Flynn’s 1977 revenge thriller
      Rolling Thunder), opened up to explain more about the character's
      inspiration, a critic who wrote for, by QT's description, a "porno rag".
      Turns out Tarantino really was checking out such magazines for the
      articles! "He wrote about mainstream movies and he was the second-string
      critic, he says I think he was a very good critic. He was as cynical as
      hell. His reviews were a cross between early Howard Stern and what [Taxi
      Driver's] Travis Bickle might be if he were a film critic. Think about
      Travis’s diary entries." He continues, "But the porno rag critic was very,
      very funny. He was very rude, you know. He cursed. He used racial slurs.
      But his shit was really funny. He was as rude as hell. He wrote like he
      was 55 but he was only in his early to mid-30s. He died in his late
      thirties. It wasn’t clear for a while but now I’ve done some more research
      and I think it was it was complications due to alcoholism." According to
      the director, he's looking to cast someone in their mid-30s for the role,
      and isn't (so far) dipping into his established repertory group. And he
      wants to cast an American, not an Australian or someone from the UK,
      mostly because he doesn't seem to buy their accent work. And while he
      appears committed to making the new movie his last big screen release,
      he'll keep on writing other projects, including plays, novels and may end
      up making a TV series. Just don't expect anything in the Bond world.
      Though Tarantino has been rumoured as looking to direct one of the movies,
      he clarifies that he's never had a formal meeting about it. Which is not
      to say he doesn't have an idea for how to do one… "I actually have a
      thought process about this. What I think they should do, and I’ve been
      thinking they should do this for a long time, is so many of the books have
      these really classic names and really classic adventures. And for the most
      part, a lot of them, they never did the book. They never did the stories.
      They took the plot line and maybe the Bond girl or maybe the villain and
      then just went their own way. Tom Mankiewicz just goes his own way. He did
      the writing for a lot of them. I think they should not remake the movies
      but actually just do the books, but do them the way they were written. And
      those would all be brand new."
