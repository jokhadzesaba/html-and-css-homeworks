      'Ted Lasso' returns Wednesday for its third season and while there are
      certainly questions about whether AFC Richmond will finally go all the way
      - or if Nate will receive his comeuppance - there's one big question: Is
      this actually the last season? The Emmy-winning Apple TV+ series, about an
      American coaching a soccer team in London, has long been described as a
      three-season series - but executive producer, writer and star Jason
      Sudeikis is noncommittal about what comes next."I'm still in it," he said
      in a recent interview. "We're still editing the last few episodes, so it's
      really something that I haven't had the time to sit with, despite the fact
      that there's a lot of wonder and curiosity ... from the press or fans -
      and certainly it seems like people in show business are equally as
      interested," he laughed. "That answer will arrive probably when there's
      enough space for the question to really land." Brendan Hunt, who plays
      assistant coach Beard, (whose first name "has not been revealed," said the
      actor. "We don't know that he doesn't have one, but he certainly appears
      to have no use for it.") is also an executive producer and writer on the
      show. "We always saw it as this three-movement suite or a three-piece
      story," Hunt says, but admits the show's success has added more questions
      than answers to that original plan. "So the door is still open for - after
      this suite is finished - that maybe we'll pick up with something else in
      this world. When asked, if there's a character from the series whom Hunt
      would like to see explored further, Hunt deadpans, "Phoebe (Roy Kent's
      young niece) as she battles London's drug-riddled crime underworld." Brett
      Goldstein, who plays Roy Kent, the Richmond player-turned-coach with a
      gruff exterior and a heart of gold, is a definite breakout. He played
      Hercules in the end credits of "Thor: Love and Thunder," and is a creator
      and executive producer on " Shrinking," also on Apple TV+. He credits "Ted
      Lasso" for giving him creative opportunities of which he had only dreamed.
      "I'd worked for years and years and years and 12 people had seen all of
      it, you know, and then doing a show that loads of people watch is
      different. It really is different," Goldstein says. "Without being cheesy,
      I learned an awful lot from working on 'Ted Lasso,' and I will take those
      lessons with me into anything else I do," he said. Toheeb Jimoh had only
      been acting professionally for two years when he got cast as player Sam
      Obisanya. "I'm at a stage where, because of this show I'm able to stand on
      my own two feet as an artist now. I've kind of absorbed the Lasso way in
      the same way that all of the players have," Jimoh says. "Ted says, 'It's
      not about the wins or losses, it's about making these players the best
      versions of themselves on and off the pitch.' I really feel that's the
      same lesson that 'Ted Lasso' has given us young actors on the show. It's
      about making us to the best versions of ourselves on and off the screen,
      you know?"

      Hannah Waddingham, who plays AFC Richmond owner Rebecca Welton, was
      already an accomplished stage performer prior to "Ted Lasso," and already
      has other exciting jobs lined up including a role in "Mission: Impossible
      - Dead Reckoning Part Two." But she still wonders if she'll ever be able
      to duplicate the "Ted Lasso" experience.

      "I don't know about you guys here, but Brits are natural worriers. It
      makes me worried that I may not ever have that again because it is such a
      beautiful kind of symbiosis with all of us," she says.
      <br />
      For now, Sudeikis seems more willing to address what the show has meant to
      him than what lies in store.
      <br />
      "I see it through the eyes of my kids when we go somewhere and the way
      people come up to to myself and .. any of us, just how loving people are,"
      he says, joking that he doubts the the cast of "Succession" gets quite the
      same reception. "I'm sure they're excited to see them because they're all
      wickedly talented, but it's a different vibe on that show and a different
      family, if you will. So, being surrounded by that type of kindness and
      have it reflected back to you - especially in front of kids or family -
      has been really, really moving"
